/* CSS: Cascading Style Sheets */

/* 
* Intoduction to CSS *
  ------------------  

# Inline CSS #
  ----------   

An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element. 
An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.

# For Example: 
<h1 style="color:blue;">A Blue Heading</h1>    |- Changing color of heading using Inline CSS


# Internal CSS #
  ------------   

An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page. 
An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, 
within a <style> element.

# For Example: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>                                      - <style>
      body {background-color: powderblue;}       |
      h1 {color: blue;}                          |- Styling body, heading, and paragraph using internal CSS
      p {color: red;}                            |
    </style>                                     - <style>
  </head>
  <body>                                         |- Body Background colour is powderblue

    <h1>This is a heading</h1>                   |- Blue Heading
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>                  |- Red Paragraph

  </body>
</html>


# External CSS #
  ------------   

An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.
To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each HTML page

# For Example: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">     |- Linking CSS file (styles.css)
  </head>
  <body>                                          |- Body Background colour is powderblue

    <h1>This is a heading</h1>                    |- Blue Heading
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>                   |- Red Paragraph

  </body>
</html>

"styles.css":                                      |- CSS file

body {
  background-color: powderblue;
}
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}

* The external style sheet file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.

/* 
* The Anatomy of CSS Syntax *
  -------------------------  

# CSS Syntax (The Grammar of the CSS Language)

                           What Property we want to change
                                            \
                                         --------
                              selector { property: value; }
                              --------             -----
                                 /                    \
                  Who's style we want to change        \
                                                        \
                               How do you/How much do you want to change that property

# For Example:

        h1 { color: red; }
        --   -----  ---  
        /      |      \
 selector { property: value; }

/* 
* CSS Selectors *
  -------------  

In CSS, selectors are patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style.

There are several different types of selectors in CSS:
* CSS Element Selector
* CSS Id Selector
* CSS Class Selector

1) CSS Element/Tag Selector
The element selector selects the HTML element by name.

# For Example: 
h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 200px;
}


2) CSS Class Selector
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute. 
It is used with a period character . (full stop symbol) followed by the class name.

# For Example: 
.circular {
  border-radius: 100%;
}


3) CSS Id Selector
The id selector selects the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
An id is always unique within the page so it is chosen to select a single, unique element.
It is written with the hash character (#), followed by the id of the element.

# For Example: 
#heading {
  color: blue;
}


# CSS :hover Selector (CSS Pseudo-class) 
The :hover selector is used to select elements when you mouse over them.

# For Example: 
img:hover {
  background-color: gold;
}
